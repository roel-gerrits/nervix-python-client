v1.0

- call verify on verbs somewhere

- add licence (LGPL?)

- encoding of payload
    run all incoming/outgoing payloads trough a decoder/encoder which prefixes the payload with a content-hint-byte or
    something.

    also write tests for this

- simulate no-interest or similar when connection is lost! so client will not post things when not
    connected.

- create_channel('nxtcp://localhost:9999') function that creates a connection and channel object in one line

- add heaps of comments to channel.py
